			<h2>Speaker <strong>Nathan Shedroff</strong></h2>

			<p class="description">Nathan Shedroff is the chair of the ground-breaking MBA in Design Strategy at California College of the Arts (CCA) in San Francisco, CA. This program melds the unique principles that design offers business strategy with a vision of the future of business as sustainable, meaningful, and truly innovative â€” as well as profitable. <!-- www.designmba.org --></p>

			<p>He is one of the pioneers in Experience Design, an approach to design that encompasses multiple senses and requirements and explores common characteristics in all media that make experiences successful, as well as related fields, Interaction Design and Information Design. He speaks and teaches internationally and has written extensively on design and business issues, including, Experience Design 1 and maintains a website with resources on Experience Design at <a href="http://www.nathan.com/ed">www.nathan.com/ed</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Nathan is a serial entrepreneur, works in several media, and consults strategically for companies to build better, more meaningful experiences for their customers. He lives in San Francisco where the climate, culture, and industry make it easy to have an esoteric and amorphous title like Experience Strategist and actually make a living.</p>

			<p>His latest book, <a href="http://www.makingmeaning.org/">Making Meaning</a>, co-written with two members of Cheskin, a Silicon Valley-based strategy consultancy, explores how companies can specifically create products and services to evoke meaning in their audiences and customers.</p>

			<p>He has three new books debuting in the beginning of 2009: <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/sustainable-design/">Design is the Problem</a>, about sustainable design; <a href="http://www.experiencedesignbooks.com/EXP1.1/index.html">Experience Design 1.1</a>, an update to his 2001 book; and Experience Design 1 Cards, a design tool based on his book that helps designers create more meaningful experiences.</p>

			<p>In 2006, Nathan earned a Masters in Business Administration at Presidio School of Management in San Francisco, CA, the only accredited MBA program in the USA specializing in Sustainable Business.</p>

			<p>Nathan earned a BS in Industrial Design, with an emphasis on Automobile Design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. However, fear of Detroit coupled with a passion for information design led Nathan into this arena, where he worked with Richard Saul Wurman at TheUnderstandingBusiness. Later, he co-founded vivid studios, a decade-old pioneering company in interactive media and one of the first Web services firms on the planet. vivid&rsquo;s hallmark was helping to establish and validate the field of information architecture, by training an entire generation of designers in the newly emerging Web industry.</p>

			<p>Nathan was nominated for a Chrysler Innovation in Design Award in 1994 and 1999 and a National Design Award in 2001.</p>

			<h2><strong>Make It So: Learning From SciFi Interfaces</strong></h2>
	
			<div class="blurb">
				<p>Make It So explores how science fiction and interface design relate to each other. The authors have developed a model that traces lines of influence between the two, and use this as a scaffold to investigate how the depiction of technologies evolve over time, how fictional interfaces influence those in the real world, and what lessons interface designers can learn through this process. This investigation of science fiction television shows and movies has yielded practical lessons that apply to online, social, mobile, and other media interfaces.</p>
