		<h2>jQuery for Designers</h2>
		<h4>Led by <a href="/schedule/remysharp/">Remy Sharp</a></h4>

		<p class="description">If you've found you've needed to write a bit (or more!) of interactive functionality using JavaScript, and couldn't because you a) didn't know how and b) didn't have time to learn how: then this workshop is for you.</p>

		<p>You'll be learning jQuery from a practical point of view: what you can use out of the box to quickly get effects and interaction live in to your wireframes, prototypes and web sites.  The aim *isn't* to teach you JavaScript, but to teach you what you need to know to be able to leverage jQuery to do your bidding.</p>

		<p>During the day, Remy will show you how to dConstruct existing effects in web sites and show you how create your own using jQuery.</p>

		<p>The workshop will also cover topics such as:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript &amp; debugging basics: how to fake it as a JavaScripter</li>
			<li>Progressive enhancement &amp; Graceful degradation - what's what</li>
			<li>jQuery: how do bend the DOM to your will</li>
			<li>Effect and animations - things that go whizz bang!</li>
			<li>Ajax: it's even simpler than you think</li>
			<li>Using jQuery UI for instant widgets, for zero work</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The workshop audience is aimed at beginners to intermediates - and it's very hands on!</p>

		<p>We'll start with covering the basics of JavaScript so that you have a good grounding and you can fake your way through coding. This will include anonymous functions, scope, context (what 'this' means in different places) and objects.  Then we'll move on to tabbing systems, how they work, how to recognise them when they don't look like tabbing systems, and then on to the juicier stuff such as effects, Ajax and jQuery UI.</p>

		<h2>Designing Mobile Experiences</h2>
		<h4>Led by <a href="/schedule/brianfling/">Brian Fling</a></h4>

		<p class="description">In the last year we've learned something that we suspected, but never really knew about mobile, great mobile design sells. But great mobile design doesn't start in Photoshop, it starts by understanding the users, the business goals, the intended devices and a million other tiny variables. Who better to solve these problems than the designer?</p>

		<p>In this workshop we will deconstruct a variety of successful mobile experiences from the old green screens to today's hottest iPhone apps. We'll identify what works in the mobile context and why. But more importantly we'll learn how we can design incredible mobile experiences for today and for tomorrow.</p>

		<p>What we will cover in this workshop:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Understanding the mobile context and how to design for it</li>
			<li>Creating a device plan and a mobile design strategy around it</li>
			<li>How to design and create progressive mobile experiences</li>
			<li>How to choose the right mobile platform and application context</li>
			<li>How to get the right designs on the right devices</li>
			<li>How to design and build something insanely great</li>
