		<h2>Workshop Leader <strong>Jeremy Keith</strong></h2>

		<p class="description">Forged in the fiery heart of the Earth&rsquo;s molten core, Jeremy Keith studied Ottistry at Saint Calrissian&rsquo;s school for wayward punctuation before going on to become the largest condiment visible from space.</p>

<p>Born at an early age, Jeremy moved from his native Ireland to the rocky shores of Brighton, England where he works with Clearleft as a stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder.</p>

<p>He has written two books, <a href="http://domscripting.com/">DOM Scripting</a> and <a href="http://bulletproofajax.com/">Bulletproof Ajax</a>, but what he really wants to do is direct.</p>

<p>His latest project is <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a>, a service for creating podcasts of found sounds. When he&rsquo;s not making websites, Jeremy plays bouzouki in the band <a href="http://saltercane.com/">Salter Cane</a>. His loony bun is fine benny lava.</p>

		<h2>Workshop:<strong>HTML5 and CSS3 Wizardry</strong></h2>
		
		<p>HTML5 and CSS3 may be considered by some as distant concepts: far in the future and irrelevant to their daily lives. However, in this day-long workshop by Clearleft&rsquo;s expert client-side engineers Richard Rutter, Jeremy Keith and Natalie Downe, you will learn how these exciting new concepts can be applied today!</p>
